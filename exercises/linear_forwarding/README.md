# Implementing Linear Forwarding

## Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to write a P4 program that implements basic forwarding over a linear topology.

## Running the Exercise

1.  In your shell, run:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

2.  You should now see a Mininet command prompt. Try to ping between h1 and h2:
    ```bash
    mininet> h1 ping h2
    ```
    The ping should succeed.

3.  Type `exit` to leave the Mininet command line.
